# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
The objective is to show customers content that they would like best based on their historical activity. 

Recommender systems are algorithms designed to help users discover movies, products, and songs by predicting the userâ€™s rating of each item and displaying similar items that they might rate high as well.

We are using Item-based collaborative filters work by recommending elements based on relationship between items and not people. 
This reduces the complexity of the problem and overcomes the challenges of user-based collaborative filtering.
